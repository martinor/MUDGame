JAM-src-v0.2 Release Notes (2000-10-22, Durin)
----------------------------------------------

This is the second release of the JAM-src package. It provides the JAM
source code written in JAVA. To start a JAM, you also need the
JAM-world package v0.2+ or a self written world, and you should have a
look at the JAM-doc package, which contains all user and technical
documentation on JAM's classes.

To start JAM, just compile Jam.java with the javac provided by the
Java SDK 1.2.2 or later and start the resulting Jam.class within the
java virtual machine.

This version of JAM provides the player with a character to identify
with. A login sequence is available as well as a command parser with a
few vital commands. Output to players will be in ansi colors if they
decide to use this feature.

The next release will provide a log facility, player stats and rolling
those stats during new player's login, a score command, help files and
an interface to them and an advanced GUI.

Changes for this version are listed in the Changelog file. Please have
a look there for details.

I'm very happy to finally be able to release the package. Sorry for
the delay.

Watch out for the upcoming v0.3...
