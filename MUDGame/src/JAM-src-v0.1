JAM-src-v0.1 Release Notes (2000-09-11, Durin)
----------------------------------------------

This is the first release of the JAM-src package. It provides
the JAM source code written in JAVA. To start a JAM, you also
need the JAM-world package or a self written world, and you
should have a look at the JAM-doc package, which contains all
user and technical documentation on JAM's classes.

To start JAM, just compile Jam.java with the javac provided by
the Java SDK 1.2.2 and start the resulting Jam.class within the
java virtual machine.

This version of JAM accepts incoming telnet connections and
writes incoming input to the console. If a GUI is available, a
window will be opened, where all active connections will
continously be listed. The server will shut down on demand.

This is just the starting point for a full Java MUD. The next
release will provide some player character functionality as well
as saved user (player) files.

Changes for this version (not really changes, you know...) are
listed in the Changelog file.

The development was interrupted by my holidays, but I'm very happy
to finally be able to release the package. Sorry for the delay.

Watch out for the upcoming v0.2...
